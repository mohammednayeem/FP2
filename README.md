# FP2 - Team Declaration

**TL;DR**

You must do either:

1. fill out this [team declaration form](https://goo.gl/forms/nSghRMlfpPzPVsi63)
2. fill out this [partner request form](https://goo.gl/forms/14dfW91t6hLAE2yn1)

## I have a team 

Once you have your team figured out, one of you fills out this **[team declaration form](https://goo.gl/forms/nSghRMlfpPzPVsi63)** for your whole team describing:
* who's on it (using github usernames and real names)
* a project title (10 words or fewer, can be changed later)
* a basic project concept
* what libraries you plan on using, as a group

Team rules:
* Teams should be two people except under special circumstances
* Working individually will only be considered with an accommodation request from Disability Services 
* Teams of more than two people require written (emailed) permission from the instructor

In looking for the team, we welcome you to use the course mailing list.
When posting on the list, be sure to include:
* what you're interested in doing
* what library you looked at for Exploration 1
* when you will be able to meet to work on project

**More information about teams**

* The normal team size is 2.
* Teams of 3 are allowed only when you have a strong case that your team needs three people to accomplish its idea. All three members must be doing well in the course. Please contact your instructor for guidance.
* Working solo will be an extraordinary exception. Please don't come to me with a request that boils down to "I really don't want to." Reasons like "I have a complicated schedule" are not applicable. 

You should know that being able to accomplish software projects in a team is how the world works. If you don't have experience doing this yet, it's even more valuable that you begin to learn now.

Given today's collaboration tools (cell phones, Google Hangouts, collaborative document editing), it's not necessary to hold all meetings in person. Synchronous meetings with collaborators in different locations can be quite productive.

So -- you will be able to do this.

**Role of team members**

As part of the project design, you will divide the work so that each person has a separate role. (Of course, the pieces are interrelated; you're building one project, not two separate ones.) 

You should do your best to make both parts equally interesting. E.g., it's not a great design if one person does all the cool algorithms, and the other person does the UI.

Make sure that each of you has an interesting, important, and fun part of the project. 

Yes, this is an additional consideration as you determine the scope of your project. But it is one that will add value.

## I want a team of three

Remember that you must have prior written permission to work in groups of three.

When requesting permission, the three of you should have met (virtually is OK) and all discussed the idea together. When emailing me about your team and your idea, you must CC your other team members in the request email. All three of you should have viewed and discussed the email before one of you sends it.

The team must nominate a lead. This person is primarily responsible for code integration. This work may be shared, but the team lead has default responsibility.

The team lead has full partner implementation responsibilities also.

You must identify who is team lead.

## I don't have a team

If you don't have a partner, please fill out this [partner request form](https://goo.gl/forms/14dfW91t6hLAE2yn1).
